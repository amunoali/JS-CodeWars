// This week we will be discovering hidden messages by manipulating a given string. Your solutions should account for any non-empty string. On Friday we'll combine our functions to decode a message.

// Oh no! How did this happen?! Somehow similar-looking numbers and letters have been confused in our document. Someone may have been messing around writing naughty words on a calculator. We need to get them back to normal.

// Below, find the mix-ups that have been made. Note: the confusion happened in both directions and was case-sensitive.


// COPY
// '0' <-> 'O'      '5' <-> 'S'
// '1' <-> 'I'      '6' <-> 'G'
// '2' <-> 'Z'      '7' <-> 'L'
// '3' <-> 'E'      '8' <-> 'B'
// '4' <-> 'h'      '9' <-> 'q'

// "PR0-T1P #hqB: 1T'5 N1C3 T0 5AY H3770." 
// // implement fix function -> 
// "PRO-TIP #498: IT'S NICE TO SAY HELLO."

//Prep
//P:taking in numbers and letters 
//r:decoding for the numbers to switch to letters so that it can spell out the word
//e:"PR0-T1P #hqB: 1T'5 N1C3 T0 5AY H3770."  ->  "PRO-TIP #498: IT'S NICE TO SAY HELLO."
//p: I can hardcode and write each letter associated with the proper number.
